# HappyRocket

Its a basic project made in order to implement steering behaviours in order to simulate a better AI-like movement system. Mostly automatic. The rocket will wander untill it finds a Radioactive rock nearby, then it will go towards it. If there is an enemy close by, it will try to fly away from it.

Made using Godot 3.0.4.
